#program practice if/elif/else: calculating weights on planets

# planet gravity: to calculate your weight on each planet you will multiply your weight by the gravity of the planet.

#This section asks the user for their weight and stores it in the variable "weight" and converts it to a float.

#It also asks the user for their planet and stores it in the variable "planet" which is represented by a number between 1 and 7.

# Ask the user for their weight in pounds and convert the input to a float. We used float because the weight can be a decimal number and any time you use a decimal you need to use float.

#the "/n" is used to create a new line within a string.
weight = float(input("Enter Weight in lb\n"))
# Ask the user to select a planet by entering a number corresponding to that planet. int will be used because our choices are integers *1,2,3..etc
planet = int(input("Enter Planet\n 1. Mercury\n 2. Venus\n 3. Earth\n 4. Mars\n 5. Jupiter\n 6. Saturn\n 7. Uranus"))

# Define veriable for the gravity relative to Earth for each planet
#to find the reletive gravity numbers look up on google.
mercuryGrav = 0.91
venusGrav = 0.93
marsGrav = 0.38
jupiterGrav = 2.34
saturnGrav = 1.06
uranusGrav = 0.92
neptuneGrav = 1.19

# Calculate and print the weight on the selected planet using the corresponding gravity factor. the forumla for the weight is weight * gravity. THe weight is then printed with a message indicating the weight on the selected planet.
