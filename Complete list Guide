# This project showcases how to use lists, 2D lists, and functions like .append() and .remove().
# It demonstrates accessing and manipulating both 1D and 2D lists.

# List from the previous semester's grades. This is a 2D list (a list of lists).
last_semester_gradebook = [
    ["politics", 80],    # Each sublist represents a subject and its corresponding grade.
    ["latin", 96],
    ["dance", 97],
    ["architecture", 65]
]

# Step 1: Create a list of subjects for the current semester (1D list).
subjects = ["physics", "calculus", "poetry", "history"]

# Step 2: Create a list of grades for the current semester (1D list).
grades = [98, 97, 85, 88]

# Step 3: Combine subjects and grades into a 2D list called gradebook.
# Each element of gradebook is a sublist containing a subject and its grade.
gradebook = [
    ["physics", 98],
    ["calculus", 97],
    ["poetry", 85],
    ["history", 88]
]

# Step 4: Add a new subject and grade to the 2D list using the .append() method.
# .append() takes one argument and adds it to the end of the list.
# Here, we are adding a new sublist ["computer science", 100] to gradebook.
gradebook.append(["computer science", 100])

# Step 5: Add another subject and grade.
gradebook.append(["visual arts", 93])

# Step 6: Modify the grade of the last subject in the list.
# To access elements in a 2D list, use two sets of brackets.
# The first bracket accesses the sublist, and the second accesses the specific item in that sublist.
# Here, gradebook[-1] gets the last sublist ["visual arts", 93].
# gradebook[-1][-1] accesses the grade in that sublist (93), and we update it to 98.
gradebook[-1][-1] = 98

# Step 7: Remove a specific sublist (subject and grade) using .remove().
# This method removes the first occurrence of the specified sublist.
# We are removing ["poetry", 85] from gradebook.
gradebook.remove(["poetry", 85])

# Step 8: Add a new subject "music" with a grade of 95 to gradebook.
gradebook.append(["music", 95])

# Step 9: Combine last semester's grades with the current semester's gradebook to form a complete grade record.
# The + operator is used to concatenate the two 2D lists.
full_gradebook = last_semester_gradebook + gradebook

# Step 10: Print the full gradebook, which now contains grades from both semesters.
print(full_gradebook)

# Explanation of output:
# The printed result will be a 2D list that includes all the subject-grade pairs from both semesters.
