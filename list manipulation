#in this section we are manipulating data in list

# Define the initial inventory list.
inventory = ["twin bed", "twin bed", "headboard", "queen bed", "king bed", "dresser", "dresser", 
             "table", "table", "nightstand", "nightstand", "king bed", "king bed", "twin bed", 
             "twin bed", "sheets", "sheets", "pillow", "pillow"]

# Checkpoint 1: Get the length of the list.
# Use len() to determine how many items are in the list.
inventory_len = len(inventory)

# Checkpoint 2: Access the first item in the list.
# Indexing starts at 0, so inventory[0] gives the first item.
first = inventory[0]

# Checkpoint 3: Access the last item in the list.
# Using negative indexing, inventory[-1] fetches the last item.
last = inventory[-1]

# Checkpoint 4: Slice the list from index 2 to 5 (up to, but not including, 6).
# Use list slicing [start:end] to get a sublist.
inventory_2_6 = inventory[2:6]

# Checkpoint 5: Get the first three items from the list.
# Slicing without a starting index defaults to the beginning (index 0).
first_3 = inventory[:3]

# Checkpoint 6: Count the number of occurrences of "twin bed".
# The count() method counts how many times a specific item appears in the list.
twin_beds = inventory.count("twin bed")

# Checkpoint 7: Remove the item at index 4.
# pop(index) removes and returns the item at the given index.
removed_item = inventory.pop(4)

# Checkpoint 8: Insert an item at a specific position (index 10).
# The insert(index, item) method places an item at the given position.
inventory.insert(10, "19th Century Bed Frame")

# Checkpoint 9: Sort the list in place.
# The sort() method arranges the list items in ascending order.
inventory.sort()

# Print the modified inventory list to see the result.
print(inventory)
